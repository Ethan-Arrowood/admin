WinterCG Call 7/28
- crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual
    - Workers is getting an implementation matching Node.js
    - Proposing this to WebCrypto; no hard disagreement expected
    - However, if it doesn’t land there we will make it apart of WinterCG agreement
    - Ongoing work in WASM about constant time operations - if interested get in touch; Daniel Ehrenberg can facilitate
- AbortSignal.any() - composing abort signals
    - Can either be manually aborted or aborted by a timer/automatic
    - Lots of interest, but no forward momentum
    - We as WinterCG can help provide that momentum; don’t expect major pushback
    - Outstanding issue is just the shape of the API
    - Daniel Ehrenberg can help get folks in touch if they are interested in helping
    - Need to collect use case examples
- ReadableStreams tee backpressure
    - When reading from one branch in a tee’d stream, data will accumulate in the other branch with no back pressure indicator
    - This is unsolved in current spec
    - James is working on a new implementation to solve this
        - First he wants to solve the implementation
        - Then he will draft the proposal for the necessary changes for the spec
        - Expects it to be non-trivial
        - Estimate by Mid August
        - Risk of push back since it could change behavior, but we don’t really know the accuracy of how much this is currently affecting folks
    - Has anyone been affected by this? 
- Workstream Updates
    - Common APIs - No new updates
    - Crypto streams
        - Feedback received: some interest, no objections, no one jumping to implement
    - Fetch subset 
        - On going discussion in relative URL 
        - Last Call Summary:
            - Agreed that we can ignore CORs and CORs-related requirements
            - Ignored things can return undefined
            - Discussion on set-cookie header. New API in Fetch being discussed (getSetCookie), we will look to adopt what they decide
            - Duplex request streams - landing in Chrome
                - When you send a fetch request you can indicate for it to be a stream
        - Request for another fetch focussed call
    - Environment data - No new updates
    - Performance
        - User timing upper limits discussion (https://github.com/w3c/user-timing/issues/92)
            - Does there need to be any API for setting these limits? 
            - Proposed to use command line options to control it
